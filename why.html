                    <h2>Perspectives</h2>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Economic Perspective</h3>
                        <p>
                            Digital media is created for a variety of reasons, whether it be for business, portfolios, promotions, or otherwise. Regardless of the reason, the purpose of a website or any form of digital media is to be received by as many people as possible. 
                            Why then, would we not want to make a website as accessible as possible, after all, the more people it can reach the better, right? Why then is so much digital media inaccessible?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Multiple arguments exist as to why a website should not be made accessible: it's too much work, too expensive, unnecessary, or simply because they are not legally required to.
                            This line of thinking, however, is severely unproductive. 
                            Effort is rarely an issue if digital media is created with universal design in mind. Even for websites that already exist but are inaccessible, conversion is not an impossible feat. Adopting the standards of universal design is good practice anyway, and will make a website more dynamic and functional.
                        </p>
                        <p>As for funds, that likely also depends on effort. But the cost of implementation will easily be outweighed by the benefits and profits of accessibility.
                            1 in 4 adults in America have some sort of disability, which for many is around 25% of their intended audience. By failing to implement accessible features, said digital media is losing out on 25% of their possible clientele. So it is not unnecessary either, not when it can be so beneficial.
                            Additionally, simply because one is not required to practice universal design does not mean it should not be done. Companies that practice these standards and guidelines are far more likely to reach wider audiences and have a better reputation due to their accessibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, from an economic perspective, adopting universal design is a highly beneficial decision.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Rights and Inclusion Perspective</h3>
                        <p>The Inclusion Principle is an idea in claiming we should embrace similarities through universal design, and differences through accessible design.
                            But what is the point of embracing similarities and differences? Why put the effort into accommodating 'one person' when you don't have to? 
                            The point is that it's not just one person, it's a population. It's the only minority that you're guaranteed to be a part of if you live long enough. 
                            Universal design is more than just having functional, responsive websites that reach wider audiences, it's also a matter of rights and representation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Accessibility is advocacy. The practice and encouragement of universally accessible digital media aids a heavily stigmatized and vulnerable population. 
                            By creating digital media that is accessible, you provide more independence to those that wish to see it, increasing your audience.
                            The fight for the rights of people with disabilities is one that has gone on for generations, and is still going on today. Thanks to the Disability Rights Movement, people with disabilities have received more protections.
                            The Rehabilitation Act, Section 504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act are the most impactful legislative Acts that have been passed to protect people with disabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People with disabilities are a vulnerable, frequently overlooked population. Anyone can join said population through accidents, incidents, or diseases. 
                            With so many people in the population, and so many more always likely to join, it's our responsibility to design inclusively. In doing so, we can help protect the rights and independence of others.

                        <h3>Responsibility Perspective</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to W3C, many standards have been passed and pushed into federal and international spaces. Having a standardized, predictable website means it can be more robust, used more widely, and received well by larger populations. 
                            But if I don't need to make my website accessible or use these standards, then why do it? If not for any of the reasons mentioned previously, then it should be designed universally simply because it is our responsibility to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>As creators of digital media, we can reach wide audiences and contribute to the preexisting social standards and expectations for technology. 
                            Those who follow the trend of not using universal design simply because of the 'effort', is discounting the purpose for technology. 
                            These federal standards exist for a reason, the W3C is recommended for a reason. These aren't just implementations for fun. People have fought for representation, for the rights to their independence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Experts have evaluated these guidelines and have found their usefulness and impact. It's our responsibility as developers to promote and practice beneficial trends.
                            For ourselves, our employers, and our communities, we need to practice universal design.

                <h2>Statistics in the United States</h2>
                <p><strong>93%</strong> of Americans use the internet</p>
                <p><strong>13%</strong> of Americans have disabilities</p>

                <p>Even more Americans use mobile devices and number is only expected to grow. With so many people in America, and around the world, having disabilities, it only makes sense to include them in our design process.</p>

                    <h3>The Civil Rights Movements</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 1970s, the disabilities rights movement drew from the civil rights and women's rights movements. People with disabilities pushed their own civil rights laws to the forefront of the public mind. At the time, the mindset around disabilities was a medical one, that the people who have them are simply charity cases.
                        One goal of the model was to shift away thinking from that, to promote legal equality and independence over pity. Particular areas of focus are those in employment rights, but also in all facets of life.

                    <h3>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973</h3>
                    <p>In 1973, the Rehabilitation Act was passed. This, however, was only due to the efforts of protestors and people with disabilities who lobbied congress to include civil rights language for people with disabilities.
                        Nixon, the president at the time, was firmly against the act. He said it was 'too expensive' or focused too much on 'medical and social welfare policies'.
                        Begrudgingly, Nixon was finally forced to pass a revised Rehabilitation Act when people with disabilities marched on Washington. However, little was done to implement or enforce the law.
                        A few years later the Individual with Disabilities Education Act was passed as well.

                    <h3>Section 504</h3>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to protests in 1977, demonstrations and sit-ins, particularly from advocates in California, they were able to push for a statute that would actually enforce the laws proposed and protect the civil liberties of people with disabilities.
                        Said statute is Section 504, which provided civil rights for people with disabilities in programs receiving federal funding. Though, it only applied to 'qualified' individuals, of which the definition has changed much over the years.
                        The section would forbid exclusion from benefits/services, requires nondiscrimination (particularly in employment), and protected more of their rights in federal areas and programs.

                    <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act</h3>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't until the 1990s that President George HW Bush pushed the Americans with Disabilities Act, aiming to remove barrier and prosper. It's a comprehensive civil rights law prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity.
                        Many disabilities were covered, but there were still many not included. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2008 is when the ADA Amendments Act passed, aiming to clarify and broaden the definition of disability in order to increase the number and types of people protected under the ADA.
                        The supreme court had tried to limit the reach of the ADA, making it harder for people with disabilities to qualify.
