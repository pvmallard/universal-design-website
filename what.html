                    <p>Universal Design has many definitions and utilizations. Some are established guidelines, and others are intelligent, empathetic practices for design. 
                       Overall, though, it is defined as inclusive, barrier-free, and human-centered design for all, regardless of ability or background.

                    <h2>W3C - World Wide Web Consortium</h2>
                    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium is an organization committed to establishing standards to improve the web and digital media development.
                        They are responsible for protocols allowing websites to be run in multiple browsers by standardizing code and development.
                        These include standards for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally they push recommendations for accessibility, ease of use, and general universal design practices.
                        Some of their initiatives and recommended standards are ARIA, WAI, and WCAG.

                        <p>WAI is an initiative pushed by W3C to develop standards and support materials for accessibility.
                            By promoting accessible standards, they promote universal design in turn. Their most prominent standards are WCAG and ARIA.

                        <h3>ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications</h3>
                        <p>ARIA is a set of HTML attributes and roles used to convey information about an element for accessibility purposes. 
                            These are used in universal design to communicate to screen readers and interfaces about the content or type of an element. 
                            It makes it more accessible, standardizes information, and interacts with assistive technologies.

                        <p>WCAG are technical standards of different levels and categories used for accessibility.
                            There are four main categories for the guidelines, divided up using the acronym POUR.
                            Alongside its standards, it has three different levels of success criteria depending on how the standards have or have not been fulfilled.
                            These are good foundations of universal design and offer more clear expectations for how digital media can be made accessible.

                    <p>General principles established to determine what makes a design universal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Equitable use:</strong> a design should be usable by everyone
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Flexible use:</strong> a design should allow features to be used in more than one way
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Simple intuitive use (KISS):</strong> Keep it simple, stupid, a design should be easy for everyone to understand and use
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Perceptible information:</strong> a design should provide all necessary information for use
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Tolerance to error:</strong> a design should protect against misuse or danger
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Size and space for approach and use:</strong> a design should have enough space for anyone to use

                    <figcaption>The Design Process</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Design Thinking follows the practices, techniques, and procedures that support and improve the design process. 
                    It's an important component of Universal Design, but it's less of a strict guideline than it is an educated practice. 
                    Some aspects of it are...
                </p>
                <h3>Divergent Thinking</h3>
                <p>To develop as many possible solutions for an issue is to think divergently: to branch off, experiment, and think indirectly. It can lead to solutions or design processes that had not previously been considered. 
                    This is great for the brainstorming or ideation phases of the design process.
                </p>
                <h3>Convergent Thinking</h3>
                <p>Divergent thinking isn't the only type of thinking that should be addressed, however. Convergent thinking involves focused problem-solving. By finding a single answer or solution to an issue and testing it accordingly, it can allow for a more responsive, direct approach. 
                    This can be particularly helpful if one is attempting to address a single concern in digital media, or when problem-solving for one disability. </p>
                <h3>Integration and Iteration</h3>
                <p>In the post ideation phases, or sometimes coinciding with them, solutions and standards can start to be integrated into the solution or prototype. 
                    Iteration is even more important though. As a prototype or idea is tested, multiple iterations must be done. Often this includes integrating more and more ideas. 
                </p>
                <h3>Human-Centered Design for All</h3>
                <p>
                    When practicing Universal Design, the easiest approach is to design with the user in mind. 
                    The product should be inclusive, barrier-free and accessible. 
                    All of this can be eased with human-centered design, where at all parts of the design process the user is considered.
                    Their needs, approaches, and issues, should be taken into account. 
                    It's particularly important in the empathizing, defining, and ideation phases of the design process.
                </p>
                <h3>Insight</h3>
                <p>Insight is empathy, and is the first, often most important step that is frequently readdressed after each stage of the design process. It falls heavily in line with human-centered design as well.
                    If you empathize with your users, audience, or issues, then you can develop the insight to best address and define the real issues. After all, one can not solve a problem if it is not first correctly defined.

                <h2>Accessibility Rich Internet Application (ARIA) Brief History</h2>
                <p>ARIA first began in 2008 as specifications. 
                    It introduced roles like 'navigation', 'banner', 'complementary', etc alongside other features focusing on accessibility.
                    Development continued, but as HTML developed alongside ARIA, some of its attributes eventually became redundant. 
                </p>
                <p>In 2010, semantic elements introduced in HTML5 would replace features like some of the previously mentioned roles. 
                    HTML5 used nav, header, and aside elements as a few that would make ARIA redundant.
                    However, these replacements wouldn't make ARIA itself useless, as there are some areas that HTML5 did not cover in terms of accessibility.
                    Features still primarily used are ones like ARIA hidden true.
                </p>
                <p>ARIA continued to develop until it was completed in 2014, and later became recommended by W3C.
                    Still, it is best to use a native HTML element over an ARIA attribute, and no ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
