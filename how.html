                    <h2>Content Structure</h2>
                    <p>Visibility and structure should be considered in page development. Child elements should describe their content, headers used in a reasonable fashion, and sections and divs used in a manner that it makes it clear what elements are part of which parent elements. Content should flow and be easy to navigate and understand.

                        <p>Contrast, size, style, and font are some aspects of typography. In general, text should be readable, legible and easy to follow. Often serif fonts are used to headings, sans serif fonts for paragraphs and general text.

                        <p>Color contrast and appeal are important in a website. Both in terms of readability and aesthetic, colors play a large part in digital media and design in general. As well as considering color blind individuals in development. Tools exist to aid in this, like color palette generators, contrast detectors, and color blind filters.

                    <p>Physical constraints are most effective when they are made visible to discourage an attempt at a wrong operation, but invisibility is also a factor. Visibility doesn't necessarily mean what can be 'seen' but what is communicated.</p>

                    <p>
                        Testing a character archetype can be a good way to ideate and empathize with an audience in ideation or testing. 
                        By creating a fictional representation of a user, how they may uniquely react with a page or space can be very assistive in generating human-centered, universal design.
                        After all, one should always focus their development around people and those that will use it.

                    <p>
                        There are various accessibility checkers, color contrast detectors or palette creators, or outlining tools that can aid in universal design. 
                        Many are free and easy to use, some even offered as extensions like WAVE, lighthouse, etc.

                    <p>
                        A consistent, simple way of getting feedback is asking others. To get the experiences and opinions of those with or without disabilities to get opinions. Some areas are easier: contrast, colors, outlines. Others can be far more informative: content distribution, navigation, general accessibility, etc.
